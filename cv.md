### Information about Me

My name is Andrey, 24 years old. I come to this course because i'm interesting in JS. I have tried to learn it few month ago but then i burned out and abandoned it until this day.
Now i wanna try it again with new motivation, new strength and a new wish. I'm fast learning in things which interesting for me. JS interesting for me especially. 

### Skills

I have learned a bit basic JS, HTML/CSS.

### Code example

```
showResult() {

        budgetMonthValue.value = this.budgetMonth;

        budgetDayValue.value = this.budgetDay;

        expensesMonthValue.value = this.expensesMonth;

        addExpensesValue.value = this.addExpenses.join(', ');

        addIncomeValue.value = this.addIncome.join(', ');

        targetMonthValue.value = Math.ceil(this.getTargetMonth());

        incomePeriodValue.value = this.calcSavedMoney();

        periodSelect.addEventListener('change', () => {

            incomePeriodValue.value = this.budgetMonth * periodAmount.textContent;

        });
}
```

### Experience and education

I haven't worked in IT, just did little projects for myself. I have finished JS course in Glo-Academy and few little courses on You-Tube.
There is little project: [calculator](https://github.com/strawberrystr1/studyJS).
